One of our lab members, Pavlin Poličar, set out to write a better implementation -- one that would be fast, simple to play around with, easy to install, and incorporate all the latest developments to generate embeddings as informative as possible. And thus came into existence openTSNE, our new Python implementation of the t-SNE algorithm. openTSNE quickly gained traction, and since its first release in 2018, has gained widespread adoption by the broader machine-learning community. The package has been downloaded well over half a million times and has garnered over 1,300 stars on GitHub. It has been relied on in numerous high-profile projects and publications in the fields of bioinformatics, physics, and psychology to quickly generate informative visualizations of complex data.\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"One of openTSNE's key features is its speed.
