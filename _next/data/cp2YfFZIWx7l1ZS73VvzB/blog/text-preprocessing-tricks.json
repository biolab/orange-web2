Since every word is a column in the BoW representation, the table can get very big if we retain all the tokens. Often, it makes sense to discard the rarest words that occur in only a few documents. We can do this with the Document frequency option. We can filter on absolute (number of documents the token appears in) or relative frequencies (percentage of documents the word appears in). Say we wish to remove words that appear in less than 10 documents. Simply write 10 in the first box of the absolute filter. The filter will automatically update the second box to go to \\\"max\\\".
