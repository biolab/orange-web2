Currently, all data is stored in working memory, while the forthcoming Orange 3.0 will be able to handle data that is stored in the database. We are working on a parallel computation architecture. Visualization of large data also presents a big challenge: we cannot transfer large amounts of data from the database to the desktop, and on the other hand it is difficult to provide a rich interactive experience if visualizations are created on the server-side. Also, most visualizations are intrinsically unsuitable for large data sets. For instance, the scatter plot represents each data instance with a symbol. Even when the datum is represented with a single pixel, only a few million data points fits on the computer screen. So in the context of big data, we will have to replace scatterplots with heatmaps.\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"What have we got so far?
