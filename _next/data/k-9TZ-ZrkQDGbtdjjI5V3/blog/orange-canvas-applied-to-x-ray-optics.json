They discovered that the data workflow paradigm, like the one used in Orange Canvas, fits their needs perfectly. They took Orange, and replaced the existing widgets with new widgets that represent sources of photons (bending magnets, in the case of ESRF), various optical elements, like lenses and mirrors, and detectors. The channels between the widgets no longer pass data tables, like in the standard Orange, but rays of photons.
