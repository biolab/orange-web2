This is because Orange is meant to be run on a laptop. A device with just a handful of CPU cores, and maybe a couple of gigabytes of RAM.

We have created a new way to store data using dask. The main advantage here is that instead of forcing all the data into memory we can instead, keep it on our hard drive until actually required for processing.

Previously there was little to no overhead when all I wanted to do was read some data from memory and display it without any kind of processing.
