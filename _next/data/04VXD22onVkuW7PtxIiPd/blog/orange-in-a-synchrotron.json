This light is captured on the beamlines, which can, for example, use infrared light to learn about the chemical composition of the samples or x-rays to learn about the samples' internal structure. The synchrotron light has a very tight beam and is very strong, which makes synchrotrons a very flexible light source. I sometimes imagine them as very big but high-quality light bulbs.
