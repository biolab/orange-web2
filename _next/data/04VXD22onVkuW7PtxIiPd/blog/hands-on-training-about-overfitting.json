The specific advantage of our proposed course is that it is entirely hands-on, can be carried out in few hours, does not require any prerequisites or much background knowledge, and is suitable for students of biomedicine or molecular biology that do not necessarily know how to code. The course layout we are proposing is practical; students learn by analyzing the data, making mistakes in the analysis that lead to overfitting, and correcting these by adjusting the workflows.\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"In the past several years, we have been giving and perfecting the lecture we are reporting in the paper.
