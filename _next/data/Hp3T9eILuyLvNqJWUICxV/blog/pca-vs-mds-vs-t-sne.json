In particular, in some recent hands-on courses, we often introduce data visualization by principal component analysis, multidimensional scaling, and t-SNE. We would start with the zoo data set, where the data set is smaller, and the difference are less pronounced. We then traverse through employee attrition data set with exciting clusters exposed in t-SNE. To finish, and especially for the academic audience, we then show and compare the three different dimensionality reduction techniques on data from single-cell gene expression data. There, t-SNE discovers clusters of same-type cells, while PCA and MDA fail to expose interesting data structures.\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(WindowScreenshot, {\n      src: \"/blog/2021-06-pca-mds-tsne/2021-06-17-mds-and-tsne.png\",\n      width: \"880\",\n      height: \"920\",\n      src: \"/blog/2021-06-pca-mds-tsne/__webp-images__/2021-06-17-mds-and-tsne.webp\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"All the data sets I have mentioned above are available in Orange through the Dataset widget.\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"While all the three methods aim to reduce the dimensionality of the data, their goal is different.
