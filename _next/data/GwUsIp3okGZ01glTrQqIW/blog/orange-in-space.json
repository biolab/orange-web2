Dr. Brunetto says Orange is an easy and friendly tool for complicated things, such as exploring the compositional diversity of the asteroid at the different scales. There are many clustering techniques he can use in Orange and he likes how he can interactively change the number of clusters and the changes immediately show in the plot.
