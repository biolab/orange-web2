Few undergrads, then mostly graduate students, some postdocs and even quite a few of the faculty staff have joined this two day course. It was a bit lighter that the one in Luxembourg, but also covered essentials of machine learning: data management, visualization and classification with quite some emphasis on overfitting on the first day, and then clustering and data projection on the second day.
