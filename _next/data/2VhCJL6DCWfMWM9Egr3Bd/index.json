Partial Least Squares (PLS) is a powerful tool that plays a crucial role in Multivariate Data Analysis (MVDA). This method is particularly valuable because the industry often deals with large, complex datasets involving numerous variables and factors. PLS is well-suited for managing these high-dimensional datasets by reducing dimensionality and extracting key information, which simplifies interpretation and analysis. With Orange, researchers can streamline its implementation, leveraging the software's intuitive workflows to drive robust and innovative analyses.","shortExcerpt":"Partial Least Squares (PLS) enhances pharmaceutical research by analyzing complex, high-dimensional datasets, addressing multicollinearity, and building predictive models.
