Partial Least Squares (PLS) is a powerful tool that plays a crucial role in Multivariate Data Analysis (MVDA). This method is particularly valuable because the industry often deals with large, complex datasets involving numerous variables and factors. PLS is well-suited for managing these high-dimensional datasets by reducing dimensionality and extracting key information, which simplifies interpretation and analysis.
