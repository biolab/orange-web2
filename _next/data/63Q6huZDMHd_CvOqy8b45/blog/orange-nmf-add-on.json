NMF finds a parts-based representation of the data due to the fact that only additive, not subtractive, combinations are allowed, which results in improved interpretability of matrix factors. That is possible because non-negativity constraints are imposed in the NMF model in contrast to SVD, PCA and ICA, which provide only holistic representations. The effect can be easily seen if we investigate heat maps produced by the scenario above.
