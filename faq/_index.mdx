  YouTube tutorial.
</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem header="I want to use Orange on big data.">

Orange provides the SQL widget, which samples data instances and enables exploratory data analysis on large datasets. You need <Link url="http://initd.org/psycopg/" name="psycopg2"/> module installed to be able to see the widget. Install it directly in Python with

```
  pip install psycopg2
```

command. You can also use <Link url="https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/resources/2uda/" name="2UDA package"/> for easier installation. Please note that Orange supports only PostgreSQL and MSSQL databases for now.

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem header="How do I add comments/annotations to my workflows?">
  There is an option in the lower left corner of the canvas. The "T" icon adds
  text comments, while the arrow icon adds an arrow. To change text size, press
  and hold the down arrow in the upper right corner of the text icon. To change
  the arrow color, press and hold the down arrow in the upper right corner of
  the arrow icon.
</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem header="How safe is my data?">
  Orange does not store any data. It is a locally installed software that can be
  used without internet connection. The only exceptions are embedding widgets,
  which send data to the server, compute and return the result. The data is
  never stored on the server.
</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem header="Can I export Orange workflow as a Python script?">
Unfortunately, no. We've{" "}

  name="debated this long and hard"
/>.

A (limited) functionality of this type would probably be possible, but would
be a very big project to do well and would cost more than the expected benefits.

<AccordionItem header="Is Orange available in other languages?">
  Unfortunately, no. Orange is constantly being updated and maintaining
  translations would require simply too much investment.

<AccordionItem header="Does Orange work with R?">
  No. Orange is a Python-based software and is as such not compatible with R.
