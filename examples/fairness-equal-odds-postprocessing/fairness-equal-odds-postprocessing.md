Another way to mitigate bias is to use a postprocessing algorithm on the model's predictions. This workflow illustrates using the Equal Odds widget as a post-processor for the Logistic Regression model. To use the post-processor, we need to connect any model to the Equalized Odds Postprocessing widget along with any needed pre-processors. Doing so ensures our model's predictions get post-processed before we evaluate them.
