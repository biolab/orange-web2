Why would we use fairness algorithms instead of simply removing the protected attribute to avoid bias? This workflow illustrates why that is not such a good idea. We compare the predictions of a model using Reweighing to those of a model on data with the protected attribute removed. We use Box Plot to visualize and compare common fairness metrics.
