For supervised problems, where data instances are annotated with class labels, we would like to know which are the most informative features. Rank widget provides a table of features and their informativity scores, and supports manual feature selection. In the workflow, we used it to find the best two features (of initial 79 from brown-selected dataset) and display its scatter plot.
