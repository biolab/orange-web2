This workflow combines the interface and visualization of classification trees with scatter plot. When both the tree viewer and the scatter plot are open, selection of any node of the tree sends the related data instances to scatter plot. In the workflow, the selected data is treated as a subset of the entire dataset and is highlighted in the scatter plot. With simple combination of widgets we have constructed an interactive classification tree browser.
