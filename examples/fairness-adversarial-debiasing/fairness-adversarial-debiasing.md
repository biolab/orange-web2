The easiest method to address bias in machine learning is to use a bias-aware model. This approach eliminates the need for fairness preprocessing or postprocessing. In this workflow, we will employ a bias-aware model named Adversarial Debasing for classification. We will train two versions of this model: one with and one without debiasing. Finally, we will compare and display the fairness metrics using a box plot widget.
