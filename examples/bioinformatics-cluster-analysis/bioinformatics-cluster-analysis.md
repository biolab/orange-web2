Analyzing the differential expression of genes characterizing clusters and enriched gene sets helps uncover specific molecular pathways and regulatory mechanisms that contribute to distinct biological functions or disease states. In this workflow, we use the Cluster Analysis to identify differentially expressed genes and the enriched gene sets that define the clusters.
