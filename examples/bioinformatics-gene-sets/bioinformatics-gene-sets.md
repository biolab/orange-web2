Studying specific genes linked to a biological process or disease can yield valuable insights. We present a workflow to analyze the expression of 284 human homologs of E.coli DNA damage-up proteins (DDPs). These DDPs fall into three gene sets: All DDPs, excluding known cancer drivers, and validated DDPs causing DNA damage in human cells. Enrichment scores are assigned using the Single Sample Scoring widget.
