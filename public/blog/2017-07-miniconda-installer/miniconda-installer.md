Orange has a new friend! It's Miniconda, Anaconda's little sister.



For a long time, the idea was to utilize the friendly nature of Miniconda to install Orange dependencies, which often misbehaved on some platforms (I see you, Windows!). Orange Miniconda-based package provides Orange with Python 3.6 and conda installer, which is then used to handle everything Orange needs for proper functioning. So sssssss-mooth!

[All installers (including Miniconda)](https://orangedatamining.com/download/)

The Miniconda package is only available for Windows. Please know that our Miniconda installer is in a beta state, but we are inviting adventurous testers to try it and report any bugs they find to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/biolab/orange3/issues/new?title=Problem%20with%20miniconda%20installer) [there won't be any of course! ;) ].



Happy testing! 🐍|🍊
