We've launched a new video series on YouTube! It is called Orange Essentials, and it covers the technical basics of working with Orange, from installation and setting up a workflow to sharing the results and interactive data exploration. It features seven short videos, which are launched weekly.

The seventh, final video shows how to turn Orange into an interactive data exploration tool. When using Orange in a full-screen mode, the option to place widgets on top is crucial. You can enable this in *Window* --> *Display Widgets On Top*. Displaying widgets over the canvas allows for a fully interactive mode. Use Windows' built-in Snap functionality to place multiple widgets side by side and observe how the results change with your selection. On Mac, this option is called Tiling, and it is available in the green button (hold it to display options).
