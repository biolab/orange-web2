We've launched a new video series on YouTube! It is called Orange Essentials, and it covers the technical basics of working with Orange, from installation and setting up a workflow to sharing the results and interactive data exploration. It features seven short videos, which will be launched weekly from now on.

The first video shows how to install Orange on different platforms. Windows users can use a standalone installer without needing administrative privileges, or they can use portable Orange, a folder containing the entire Orange content that requires no installation. Mac users can select between the Apple Silicon or Intel versions. If you are a Linux user or wish to install Orange programmatically, you can do so with the Anaconda environment, pip, or by installing from source.

The development of the Orange Essentials video series was possible thanks to the NumFocus [Small Development Grant](https://numfocus.org/programs/small-development-grants).
