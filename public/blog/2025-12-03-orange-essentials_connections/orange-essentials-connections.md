We've launched a new video series on YouTube! It is called Orange Essentials, and it covers the technical basics of working with Orange, from installation and setting up a workflow to sharing the results and interactive data exploration. It features seven short videos, which are launched weekly.

The third video shows how to manage connections in Orange workflows. Orange widgets can have several inputs and outputs. For example, the Data Table can output either a selected subset or the entire data set. The Scatter Plot can accept a dataset as a whole, a subset of data, or features that can be used to set the graph axes. Double-clicking the connection opens a connection manager, where you can set what to put on the output and what to accept as input.
