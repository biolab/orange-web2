We've launched a new video series on YouTube! It is called Orange Essentials, and it covers the technical basics of working with Orange, from installation and setting up a workflow to sharing the results and interactive data exploration. It features seven short videos, which will are launched weekly.

The second video demonstrates how to get started with Orange by creating a simple workflow. We present canvas and widgets. Canvas is the platform for building analytical workflows by stacking widgets together. Widgets are analytical components that perform different tasks, from data loading and processing to visualisation and modelling.

We demonstrate two ways for creating a workflow, the faster of which involves using the right-click to open a menu on the canvas, typing the name of the widget, and adding it by pressing Enter. To add another widget, drag a line from the output (right) side of the widget. Releasing the button will open another menu, where you once again type the name of the subsequent widget and press Enter. Voila, here is a simple workflow!
