After months of preparation, the [DALI4US](https://www.dali4us.eu) project has officially kicked off! This week, we finally met the teachers from more than 50 primary schools across Slovenia who are taking part in our data literacy experiment, which is also taking place in Ireland and Luxembourg.

During the introductory webinar, we presented the four challenges that teachers will explore with their students. The teachers got to know our team from the University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Computer and Information Science, learned more about the practical details of the activities, and met fellow participants from the Slovenian cohort of the DALI4US project.

During the meeting, we shared all the materials teachers will need to start the activities - including [written instructions](https://notes.biolab.si/books/dali4us/izleti-v-ui) and short [video tutorials](https://lnkd.in/daJezTr4).

Now it's time for the learning adventures to begin! Over the coming months, teachers and students across the three countries will dive into the world of recommendation systems, classification, clustering, and reinforcement learning - discovering how computers learn and what we mean when we talk about artificial intelligence.

We can't wait to hear how teachers bring these activities to life and what new questions and ideas will emerge along the way!
