To add a new file to the database, select the domain and the organism of the data. Give the data set a name and, optionally, tag it with appropriate tags. Finally, use the *Select File* button to load the local file. Press OK to complete the process. The data will be stored in a cached folder **locally**. To see the full path to the data, hover on the data set name.
