Example
-------

Here is a simple example how to use **Save Images**. We loaded 14 paintings from Picasso, sent them to [Image Embedding](imageembedding.md) using *Painters* embedder, then to [Distances](https://orange-visual-programming.readthedocs.io/widgets/unsupervised/distances.html) using cosine distance and finally to [Hierarchical Clustering](https://orange-visual-programming.readthedocs.io/widgets/unsupervised/hierarchicalclustering.html) to construct a dendrogram. Then we selected a cluster from the plot and saved the images belonging to the selected cluster with **Save Images**.
