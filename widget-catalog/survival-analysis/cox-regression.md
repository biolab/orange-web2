Cox Regression
================
Fit the Cox regression model on input data.

**Inputs**

- Data: reference survival dataset
- Preprocessor: preprocessing method

**Outputs**

- Learner: Cox regression learning algorithm
- Model trained model
- Coefficients: Cox regression coefficients

**Cox Regression** is a method for investigating the effect of several variables upon the time a specified event takes to happen. It assumes that the effects of the predictor variables upon survival are constant over time and are additive in one scale.

Example
-------

In this example we estimate the concordence index for the Cox regression model trained on data instances from selected features by using cross-validation. The concordance index quantifies the quality of rankings and is the standard performance measure for model assessment in survival analysis.We first load the German breast cancer study group 2 (German BC2) dataset using the widget [Datasets](https://orangedatamining.com/widget-catalog/data/datasets/). Next we input the data into the [Rank Survival Features](https://orangedatamining.com/widget-catalog/survival-analysis/rank-survival-features/) widget and select the top two most informative features, Number of Positive Nodes and Progesterone Receptor. We input this reduced dataset comprised only of the selected features and the **Cox Regression** learner into [Test and Score](https://orangedatamining.com/widget-catalog/evaluate/testandscore/), where we can inspect the cross-validated concordance measure.
