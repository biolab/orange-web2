Logistic Regression
===================

The logistic regression classification algorithm with LASSO (L1) or ridge (L2) regularization.

**Inputs**

- Data: input dataset
- Preprocessor: preprocessing method(s)

**Outputs**

- Learner: logistic regression learning algorithm
- Model: trained model
- Coefficients: logistic regression coefficients

**Logistic Regression** learns a [Logistic Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression) model from the data. It only works for classification tasks.

1. A name under which the learner appears in other widgets. The default name is "Logistic Regression".
2. [Regularization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics)) type (either [L1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares#Lasso_method) or [L2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikhonov_regularization)). Set the cost strength (default is C=1).
3. Press *Apply* to commit changes. If *Apply Automatically* is ticked, changes will be communicated automatically.

Preprocessing
-------------

Logistic Regression uses default preprocessing when no other preprocessors are given. It executes them in the following order:

- removes instances with unknown target values
- continuizes categorical variables (with one-hot-encoding)
- removes empty columns
- imputes missing values with mean values

To remove default preprocessing, connect an empty [Preprocess](/widget-catalog/model/../data/preprocess) widget to the learner.

Feature Scoring
---------------

Logistic Regression can be used with Rank for feature scoring. See [Learners as Scorers](/widget-catalog/model/../../learners-as-scorers/index) for an example.

Example
-------

The widget is used just as any other widget for inducing a classifier. This is an example demonstrating prediction results with logistic regression on the *hayes-roth* dataset. We first load *hayes-roth_learn* in the [File](../data/file.md) widget and pass the data to **Logistic Regression**. Then we pass the trained model to [Predictions](/widget-catalog/model/../evaluate/predictions).

Now we want to predict class value on a new dataset. We load *hayes-roth_test* in the second **File** widget and connect it to **Predictions**. We can now observe class values predicted with **Logistic Regression** directly in **Predictions**.
