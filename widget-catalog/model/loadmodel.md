3. Reload the selected model.

Example
-------

When you want to use a custom-set model that you've saved before, open the **Load Model** widget and select the desired file with the *Browse* icon. This widget loads the existing model into [Predictions](../../evaluate/predictions/) widget. Datasets used with **Load Model** have to contain compatible attributes!
