We will retrieve 240 articles mentioning *slovenia* between september 2017 and september 2018. The text will include article headline and content. Upon pressing *Search*, the articles will be retrieved.

We can observe the results in the [Corpus Viewer](/widget-catalog/text-mining/corpusviewer) widget.
