Integrate Spectra
=================

Integrate spectra in various ways.

**Inputs**

- Data: input dataset

**Outputs**

- Integrated Data: data with integrals appended
- Preprocessor: preprocessing method

The **Integrate Spectra** widget allows you to add integrals to your data by selecting regions of interest and integrating them with several methods.

1. Add integral:
   - Integral from 0:
     - The sum of the area under the curve above (+) and below (-) zero. The integral is calculated using the [trapezoidal method](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.trapezoid.html).
   - Integral from baseline:
     - The sum of the area under the curve above (+) and below (-) a baseline defined as a straight line between the integral endpoints. The integral is calculated using the trapezoidal method.
   - Absolute integral from baseline: 
     - The _absolute value_ of the area under the curve above and below the baseline defined as a straight line through the integral endpoints.
   - Peak from 0:
   - Peak from baseline:
   - Closest value:
   - X-value of maximum from 0:
   - X-value of maximum from baseline
2. Toggle preview.
3. Preview plot with its editor menu like in the [Spectra](/widget-catalog/spectroscopy/spectra) widget.
4. Show a subsample of the spectra (implemented for performance).
5. Output integrals as meta attributes. Otherwise only integrals will be output. Commit to send the changes to the output.

Example
-------

This is a simple example on how to use the **Integrate Spectra** widget. The widget provides many options for integrating spectral areas and the results are appended as additional columns to the data.

We are using the *liver spectroscopy* data set from the **Datasets** widget. In **Integrate Spectra** we have selected *integral from 0* and set the lower and upper limit with the red lines. We could also do it by setting the *Low limit* and *High limit* values on the left.

To observe the integrated area, we need to press the triangular play button next to the method. To output the data, we need to press *Commit*.

Finally, we can observe the additional column with the integral values of the area in a **Data Table**.
