HyperSpectra
============

Plots 2D map of hyperspectra.

**Inputs**

- Data: input dataset

**Outputs**

- Selection: spectra from selected area
- Data: dataset with information whether a spectrum was selected or not

The **HyperSpectra** widget plots hyperspectra that were read from the *.map* file. To use this widget with infrared spectral data, you need to transform it with **Reshape Map** widget.

At the top, **HyperSpectra** shows a 2D map of a slice of the spectra. At the bottom, a spectra plot is shown with the red line indicating the wavenumber slice we are observing at the top.

1. Image values: define the transformation (usually an integral) of the spectra or use a feature to use as values for the plot. The former transformation can be an *integral from 0*, *integral from baseline*, *peak from 0*, *peak from baseline*, *closest value*, *X-value of maximum from 0* or *X-value of maximum from baseline*.
2. The hyperspectral plot of the slice of the spectra.
   - Zoom in (Z): zoom in to the area selected from the hyperspectral plot
   - Zoom to fit (backspace): return to the original plot
   - Select (square) (S): select an area from the plot by clicking at the top left corner and then the bottom right corner of the desired selection area
   - Select (polygon) (P): select an area by circumscribing a polygon
   - Save graph (Mod + S): save the visualization as a .png, .svg or .pdf file.
   - Axis x: define the attribute for the x axis
   - Axis y: define the attribute for the y axis
   - Color: select the color for the plot
3. The spectral plot of the selected image region. It behaves like the [Spectra](/widget-catalog/spectroscopy/spectra) widget.
4. Region selectors for the chosen integration method.
5. Split between image and spectral view: move it to increase the image size.
