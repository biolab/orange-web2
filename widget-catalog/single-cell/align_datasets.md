1. Data source indicator
2. Number of components for canonical correlation analysis.
3. Number of shared genes and the scoring method for alignment. Scoring can be done with [Pearson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient), [Spearman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient) and [Biweights midcorrelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biweight_midcorrelation).
4. Tick the box to use the percent of quantile normalization and dynamic time warping.
5. If *Apply automatically* is ticked, the results will be communicated automatically. Alternatively, press *Apply*.
