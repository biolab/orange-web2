The **EnKlik Anketa** widget retrieves survey results obtained from the [EnKlikAnketa](http://english.1ka.si/) service. You need to create a public link to to retrieve the results. Go to the survey you wish to retrieve, then select Data (Podatki) tab and create a public link (javna povezava) at the top right corner.

Example
-------

**EnKlik Anketa** widget is great for observing results from online surveys. We have created a sample survey and imported it into the widget. We have 41 responses and we have asked 8 questions, 7 of which were recognized as features and 1 as a meta attribute.

The widget sets questions from the survey as feature names. This, however, might be slightly impractical for analytical purposes, as we can see in the **Data Table**. We will shorten the names with **Edit Domain** widget.

**Edit Domain** enables us to change attribute names and even rename attribute values for discrete attributes. Now our attribute names are much easier to work with, as we can see in **Data Table (1)**.
