Document maps may reveal clusters of documents with semantically similar content. Here we show a workflow that loads the corpus, performs some text preprocessing and embeds the documents in the vector space using the fastText deep model. The t-SNE widget reveals the document map, where we can select a set of documents and then explore them in Corpus Viewer or characterize them in the display of the most frequent words in the Word Cloud.
