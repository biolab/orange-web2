We use the zoo data set in combination with Hierarchical Clustering to discover groups of animals. Now that we have the clusters we want to find out what is significant for each cluster! Pass the clusters to Box Plot and use 'Order by relevance' to discover what defines a cluster. Seems like they are well-separated by the type, even though the clustering was unaware of the class label!
