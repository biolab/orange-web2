Pivot Table can help us aggregate and transform the data. This workflow takes Kickstarter projects and aggregates them by month. We can inspect the frequency of the published projects per month and observe the difference between funded and non-funded projects. Try constructing several tables with pivot and experiment with different aggregation methods.
