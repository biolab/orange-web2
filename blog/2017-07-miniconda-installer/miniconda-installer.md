Orange has a new friend! It's Miniconda, Anaconda's little sister.



For a long time, the idea was to utilize the friendly nature of Miniconda to install Orange dependencies, which often misbehaved on some platforms. Miniconda provides Orange with Python 3.6 and conda installer, which is then used to handle everything Orange needs for proper functioning. So sssssss-mooth!

Please know that our Miniconda installer is in a beta state, but we are inviting adventurous testers to try it and report any bugs they find to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/biolab/orange3/issues/new?title=Problem%20with%20miniconda%20installer) [there won't be any of course! ;) ].



Happy testing! üêç|üçä
