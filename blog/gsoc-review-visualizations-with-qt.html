I can say that I have succesfully completed my project, but the library (and especially the visualization widgets) could still use some more work. The new library supports a similar interface, so little change is needed to convert individual widgets, but it also has several advantages over the old implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Animations: When using a single curve to show all data points, data changes only move the points instead of replacing them. These moves are now animated, as are color and size changes.</li>
<li>Multithreading: All position calculations are done in separate threads, so the interface remains responsive even when an long operation is running in the background.</li>
<li>Speed: I removed several occurances of needlessly clearing and repopulating the graph.</li>
<li>Simplicity: Because it was written with Orange in mind, the new library has functions that match Orange&#x27;s data structures. This leads to simpler code in widgets using the library, and less operations in Python.</li>
<li>Appearance: The plot can use the system palette, or a custom color theme. In general, I think it looks much nicer that Qwt-based plots.</li>
<li>Documentation: There is an extensive API documentation (will soon be available at <a href="/doc/orange25/OrangeWidgets.plot.html">Orange 2.5 documentation</a>), as well as two widget examples.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are also disadvantages to using the new library. They are not many, and I&#x27;ve been trying to keep them as few and as small as possible, but there still are some.</p>
<ul>
<li>Line rendering: For some reason, whenever lines are rendered on the plot, the whole widget starts acting very slow. The effect is even more noticeable when zooming. As far as I can tell, this happens in Qt&#x27;s drawing libraries, so there is not much I can do about it.</li>
<li>Axis labels: With a large number of long axis labels, the formatting gets rather ugly. This is a minor inconvenience, but it does make the plots look unprofessional.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fortunately, I have little school obligations this september, so I think I will be able to work on Orange some more, at least until school starts. I have already added gesture support and some minor improvements since the end of the program.</p>
<p>Finally, I&#x27;d like to take this opportunity to thank the Orange team, especially my mentor Miha, for accepting me and helping me throughout the summer. It&#x27;s been an interesting project, and I&#x27;ll be happy to continue working with the same software and the same team.</p></div></div></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"author":"BIOLAB","date":"2011-09-03 08:28:00+00:00","draft":false,"title":"GSoC Review: Visualizations with Qt","type":"blog","blog":["gsoc","plot","qt","visualization"]},"content":{"compiledSource":"/*@jsxRuntime automatic @jsxImportSource react*/\nconst {Fragment: _Fragment, jsx: _jsx, jsxs: _jsxs} = arguments[0];\nconst {useMDXComponents: _provideComponents} = arguments[0];\nfunction _createMdxContent(props) {\n  const _components = Object.assign({\n    p: \"p\",\n    ul: \"ul\",\n    li: \"li\",\n    a: \"a\"\n  }, _provideComponents(), props.components);\n  return _jsxs(_Fragment, {\n    children: [_jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"During the course of this summer, I created a new plotting library for Orange plot, replacing the use of PyQwt.
