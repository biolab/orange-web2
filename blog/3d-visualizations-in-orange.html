The library is designed to be similar in terms of API to the new <a href="/blog/2011/09/03/gsoc-review-visualizations-with-qt/">Qt plotting library</a> Noughmad is working on.</p>
<p>The library uses OpenGL 2/3: since Khronos deprecated parts of the old OpenGL API (particularly immediate mode and fixed-function functionality) care has been taken to use only capabilities less likely to go away in the years to come. All the drawing is done using shaders; geometry data is fed to the graphics hardware using Vertex Buffers. The library is fully functional under OpenGL 2.0; when hardware supports newer versions (3+), several optimizations are possible (e.g. geometry processing is done on the GPU rather than on CPU), possibly resulting in improved user experience.</p>
<p>Widgets I worked on and are reasonably usable:</p>
<h4>ScatterPlot3D</h4>
<p><img src="/blog/2011-09-3d-visualizations-in-orange/scatterplot3d.png__160x160_q95_crop_subject_location-291%2C305.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>Its GUI has the same options as the ordinary ScatterPlot (2D),with an additional dropdown for the third attribute (Z) and some new checkboxes (e.g. 2D/3D symbols). The data can be easily rotated, translated and scaled.Supports zoom levels and selections as well. VizRank works.Thanks to hardware acceleration, ScatterPlot3D is quite responsive even with largerdatasets (30k examples).</p>
<h4>LinProj3D</h4>
<p><img src="/blog/2011-09-3d-visualizations-in-orange/linproj3d.png__160x160_q95_crop.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>LinProj3D is displayed using dark theme (themes are available in all 3D widgets).</p>
<h4>Sphereviz3D</h4>
<p><img src="/blog/2011-09-3d-visualizations-in-orange/sphereviz.png__160x160_q95_crop.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>Sphereviz3D has 2D symbols option enabled (also available in all 3D widgets). VizRank has been modified to work with three dimensions; PCA and SPCA options under FreeViz return first three most important components when used in these widgets.</p>
<h3>Future</h3>
<p>Documentation for widgets and the library is still missing. Some additional widgets are being considered, such as NetExplorer3D.</p>
<p>I wrote few technical details <a href="http://matejd.github.com/">here</a>.</p></div></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"author":"BIOLAB","date":"2011-09-07 10:30:00+00:00","draft":false,"title":"3D Visualizations in Orange","type":"blog","blog":["opengl","visualization"]},"content":{"compiledSource":"/*@jsxRuntime automatic @jsxImportSource react*/\nconst {Fragment: _Fragment, jsx: _jsx, jsxs: _jsxs} = arguments[0];\nconst {useMDXComponents: _provideComponents} = arguments[0];\nfunction _createMdxContent(props) {\n  const _components = Object.assign({\n    p: \"p\",\n    a: \"a\",\n    h4: \"h4\",\n    img: \"img\",\n    h3: \"h3\"\n  }, _provideComponents(), props.components);\n  return _jsxs(_Fragment, {\n    children: [_jsxs(_components.p, {\n      children: [\"Over the summer I worked (and still do) on several new 3D visualization widgets as well as a 3D plotting library they use, which will hopefully simplify making more widgets.
