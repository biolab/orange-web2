At University of Ljubljana we have hosted an inspiring pack of scientists from the <a href="http://tdccbr.med.utoronto.ca/">Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research</a> from Toronto. Part of the event was a hands-on workshop Data mining without programing, where we have used Orange to analyze data from systems biology. Data included a subset of Charlie Boone&#x27;s famous yeast interaction data and data from chemical genomics. For the program, info about the speakers, and panckages and šmorn check out <a href="/blog/2014-10-hands-on-orange-at-functional-genomics-workshop/fg-times.pdf">workshop&#x27;s newspaper</a>.</p>
<p>It is always a pleasure seeing a packed lecture room with all laptops running Orange. Attendees were assisted by members of the Biolab in Ljubljana. Hands-on program followed <a href="/blog/2014-10-hands-on-orange-at-functional-genomics-workshop/fungen-workshop-notes.pdf">a set of short lectures</a> we have crafted for intended audience – biologists. Everything ran smoothly. At the end, we got excited enough to promise a data import wizard for all those that have problems annotating the data with feature type tags. The deadline: two weeks from the end of the workshop.</p>
