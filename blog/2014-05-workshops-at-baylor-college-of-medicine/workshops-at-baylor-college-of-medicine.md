On May 22nd and May 23rd, we ([Blaz Zupan](http://www.biolab.si/en/blaz-zupan/default.html) and [Janez Demsar](http://www.fri.uni-lj.si/en/janez-demsar), assisted by [Marinka Zitnik](http://www.fri.uni-lj.si/en/marinka-zitnik/default.html) and Balaji Santhanam) have given two hands-on workshops called [Data Mining without Programming](https://www.bcm.edu/research/centers/computational-and-integrative-biomedical-research/index.cfm?pmid=25960) at [Baylor College of Medicine](https://www.bcm.edu/) in Houston, Texas.

Actually, there was a lot of programming, but no Python or alike. The workshop was designed for biomedical students and Baylor's faculty members. We have presented a visual programming approach for development of data mining workflows for interactive data exploration. A three-hour workshop consisted of [15 data mining lessons](http://goo.gl/vNsk54) on visual data exploration, classification, clustering, network analysis, and gene expression analytics. Each lesson focused on a particular data analysis task that the attendees solved with Orange.

The two workshops were organized by [Baylor's Computational and Integrative Biomedical Research Center](https://www.bcm.edu/research/centers/computational-and-integrative-biomedical-research). Over two days, the event was attended by a large audience of 120 attendees.
