About a week ago we issued an updated stable release of Orange, version 3.3.1. We've introduced some new functionalities and improved a few old ones.

Here's what's new in this release:


* New widgets: Distance Matrix for visualizing distance measures in a matrix, Distance Transformation for normalization and inversion of distance matrix, Save Distance Matrix and Distance File for saving and loading distances. Last week we also mentioned a really amazing [Silhouette Plot](/blog/2016/03/23/all-i-see-is-silhouette/), which helps you visually assess cluster quality.

* **FCBF** algorithm has been added to Rank for feature scoring and ReliefF now supports missing target values.

* Graphs in Classification Tree Viewer can be saved in **.dot** format.
