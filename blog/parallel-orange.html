<p>We would like to have a framework that is easy to use, can be used in C as well as in Python and supports multi-level map reduce (cross validation can be viewed as map reduce and random forest that is tested is another map-reduce). Prototypes we have created so far solve this problem by inspecting learners that are used in cross-validation and creating all &quot;subtasks&quot; at the same time.
