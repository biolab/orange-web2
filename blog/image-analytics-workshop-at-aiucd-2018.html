The workshop was intended to familiarize digital humanities researchers with options that visual programming environments offer for image analysis.</p>

<p>In about 5 hours we discussed image embedding, clustering, finding closest neighbors and classification of images. While it is often a challenge to explain complex concepts in such a short time, it is much easier when working with Orange.</p>

<p>One of the workflows we learned at the workshop was the one for finding the most similar image in a set of images. This is better explained with an example.</p>
<p>We had 15 paintings from different authors. Two of them were painted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Monet">Claude Monet</a>, a famous French impressionist painter. Our task was, given a reference image of Monet, to find his other painting in a collection.</p>

<p>A collection of images. It includes two Monet paintings.</p>
<p>First, we loaded our <a href="http:file.biolab.si/images/Paintings.zip">data set</a> with Import Images. Then we sent our images to Image Embedding. We selected Painters embedder since it was specifically <a href="http:blog.kaggle.com/2016/11/17/painter-by-numbers-competition-1st-place-winners-interview-nejc-ilenic/">trained to recognize authors of paintings</a>.</p>

<p>We used Painters embedder here.</p>
<p>Once we have described our paintings with vectors (embeddings), we can compare them by similarity. To find the second Monet in a data set, we will have to compute the similarity of paintings and find the one most similar one to our reference painting.</p>

<p>Let us connect Image Embedding to Neighbors from Prototypes add-on. Neighbors widget is specifically intended to find a number of closest neighbors given a reference data point.</p>
<p>We will need to adjust the widget a bit. First, we will need cosine distance, since we will be comparing images by the content, not the magnitude of features. Next, we will tick off <em>Exclude reference</em>, in order to receive the reference image on the output. We do this just for visualization purposes. Finally, we set the number of neighbors to 2. Again, this is just for a nicer visualization, since we know there are only two Monet&#x27;s paintings in the data set.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2018-02-image-analytics-workshop-at-aiucd-2018/Screen-Shot-2018-02-02-at-10.42.59.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>Neighbors was set to provide a nice visualization. Hence we ticked off Exclude references and set Neighbors to 2.</p>
<p>Then we need to give Neighbors a reference image, for which we want to retrieve the neighbors. We do this by adding Data Table to Image Embedding, selecting one of Monet&#x27;s paintings in the spreadsheet and then connecting the Data Table to Neighbors. The widget will automatically consider the second input as a reference.</p>

<p>Monet.jpg is our reference painting. We select it in Data Table.</p>
<p>Now, all we need to do is to visualize the output. Connect Image Viewer to Neighbors and open it.</p>

<p>Voila! The widget has indeed found the second Monet&#x27;s painting. So useful when you have thousands of images in your archive!</p></div></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"author":"AJDA","date":"2018-02-02 10:32:28+00:00","draft":false,"title":"Image Analytics Workshop at AIUCD 2018","type":"blog","blog":["addons","analysis","conference","embedding","images","visualization","workshop"]},"content":{"compiledSource":"/*@jsxRuntime automatic @jsxImportSource react*/\nconst {Fragment: _Fragment, jsx: _jsx, jsxs: _jsxs} = arguments[0];\nconst {useMDXComponents: _provideComponents} = arguments[0];\nfunction _createMdxContent(props) {\n  const _components = Object.assign({\n    p: \"p\",\n    a: \"a\",\n    img: \"img\",\n    strong: \"strong\",\n    em: \"em\"\n  }, _provideComponents(), props.components);\n  return _jsxs(_Fragment, {\n    children: [_jsxs(_components.p, {\n      children: [\"This week, Primož and I flew to the south of Italy to hold a workshop on \", _jsx(_components.a, {\n        href: \"http://www.aiucd2018.uniba.it/workshops.html\",\n        children: \"Image Analytics through Data Mining\"\n      }), \" at \", _jsx(_components.a, {\n        href: \"http://www.aiucd2018.uniba.it/index.html\",\n        children: \"AIUCD 2018 conference\"\n      }), \".
