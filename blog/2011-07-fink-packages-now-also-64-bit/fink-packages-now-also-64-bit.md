[Fink packages](http://www.finkproject.org/) (we are using for system-wide Orange installations on Mac OS X) were updated to 64-bit. So if you were using 64-bit Fink installation you will be now able also to use Orange (and our binary Fink repository of already compiled packages). Just use this [this installation script](/svn/orange/trunk/install-scripts/mac/fink-selfupdate-orange.sh) to configure your local Fink installation to use our binary Fink repository and add information about Orange packages (they are not available among official Fink packages).
