<p>We were giving out Orange stickers (with the URL) to the poster&#x27;s visitors. There was some interest; in the end we gave out about 10 of them, mostly to biologists, who were excited to perform some of the analysis themselves. Among the visitors was also a developer of a similar tool who seemed slightly surprised that something like this already exists, while another was disappointed because Orange only runs locally.</p>
