This year Orange is again participating in [Google Summer of Code](https://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2012) as a mentoring organization. Student proposal submission period is running and the deadline is on 6th April. We have prepared [a page on our Trac](http://orange.biolab.si/trac/intertrac/wiki%3AGSoC) with more information about the Google Summer of Code program, especially how the interested students should apply with their proposals. There is also a list of [of some ideas we are proposing](http://orange.biolab.si/trac/intertrac/wiki%3AGSoC/Ideas) for this year but feel free to suggest your own ideas how you could contribute to Orange and make it even better.



Google Summer of Code is a [Google](http://www.google.com/)-sponsored program where Google stipends students working for a summer job on an open source projects from all around the world. Student is paid $5000 (and a t-shirt!) for approximately two months of work/contribution to the project. More about the program is available on [its homepage](http://socghop.appspot.com/).
