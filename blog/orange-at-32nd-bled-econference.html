Mirjana Kljajić, we participated in the <a href="http://bledconference.org/index.php/about/">32nd Bled eConference</a>. The conference is one of the most important in the region on trends and technologies for electronic communication and this year a short workshop on Data Science with Orange was included in its programme.</p>
<img src="/blog/2019-06-bled-econference/2019-06-28_bled1.png"/>
<p>\</p>
<p>We covered many topics, including data loading, visualization, construction of a predictive modeling workflow, exploration of decision trees, overfitting, model scoring and of course finally predicting with cross-validated model on a new data set. One of the classic exercises for such courses includes using the <em>Attrition - Train</em> and <em>Attrition - Predict</em> data sets from the Datasets widget and answering the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find one or two interesting variables in a Box Plot and describe what they show.</li>
<li>Use all known models in Test and Score. Which one has the highest classification accuracy?</li>
<li>Which three variables are the most important predictors for Logistic Regression?</li>
<li>On a new data set, identify the person that is most likely to quit.</li>
<li>What would be your recommendations to the HR department, considering the Nomogram?</li>
</ul>
