<p>We are using EnKlik Anketa service, which is a great Slovenian product offering a wide array of options for the creation of surveys. We have created one such simple survey to use as a test. I am now inside EnKlik Anketa online service and I can see my survey has been successfully filled out.</p>

<p>Now I have to create a public link to my survey in order to access the data in Orange. I have to click on an icon in the top right part and select &#x27;Public link&#x27;.</p>

<p>A new window opens, where I select &#x27;Add new public link&#x27;. This will generate a public connection to my survey results. But be careful, the type of the connection needs to be Data, not Analysis! Orange can&#x27;t read already analyzed data, it needs raw data from Data pane.</p>

<p>Now, all I have to do is open Orange, place EnKlik Anketa widget from the Prototypes add-on onto the canvas, enter the public link into the &#x27;Public link URL&#x27; fields and press Enter. If your data has loaded successfully, the widget will display available variables and information in the Info pane.</p>

<p>From here on you can continue your analysis just like you would with any other data source!</p>
