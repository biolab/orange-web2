We bet you've always wanted to use your SQL data in Orange, but you might not be quite sure how to do it. Don't worry, we're coming to the rescue.

The key to SQL files is installation of '_psycopg2_' library in Python.



**WINDOWS**

Go to [this website](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#psycopg) and download _psycopg2_ package. Once your .whl file has downloaded, go to the file directory and run command prompt. Enter “pip install [file name]” and run it.



**MAC OS X, LINUX**

If you’re on Mac or Linux, install _psycopg2_ with [this](http://initd.org/psycopg/docs/install.html).

Upon opening Orange, you will be able to see a lovely new icon - **SQL Table**. Then just connect to your server and off you go!
