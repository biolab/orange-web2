MF - Matrix Factorization Techniques for Data Mining is a Python scripting library which includes a number of published matrix factorization algorithms, initialization methods, quality and performance measures and facilitates the combination of these to produce new strategies. The library represents a unified and efficient interface to matrix factorization algorithms and methods.

The MF works with numpy dense matrices and scipy sparse matrices (where this is possible to save on space). The library has support for multiple runs of the algorithms which can be used for some quality measures. By setting runtime specific options tracking the residuals error within one (or more) run or tracking fitted factorization model is possible. Extensive documentation with working examples which demonstrate real applications, commonly used benchmark data and visualization methods are provided to help with the interpretation and comprehension of the results.

* Extending Bayesian methods with variational BD and linearly constrained BD.
* Adaptation of the PMF model to interval-valued matrices.
* Nonnegative matrix approximation. Multiplicative iterative schema.



### Usage

```
    # Import MF library entry point for factorization
    import mf

    from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix
    from scipy import array
    from numpy import dot
    # We will try to factorize sparse matrix. Construct sparse matrix in CSR format.
    V = csr_matrix((array([1,2,3,4,5,6]),array([0,2,2,0,1,2]),array([0,2,3,6])),shape=(3,3))

    # Run Standard NMF rank 4 algorithm
    # Returned object is fitted factorization model. 
    # Through it user can access quality and performance measures.
    fit = mf.mf(V,method = "nmf",max_iter = 30,rank = 4,update = 'divergence',objective = 'div')

    # Basis matrix. It is sparse, as input V was sparse as well.
    W = fit.basis()
    print "Basis matrix\n", W.todense()

    # Mixture matrix. We print this tiny matrix in dense format.
    H = fit.coef()
    print "Coef\n", H.todense()

    # Return the loss function according to Kullback-Leibler divergence. 
    print "Distance Kullback-Leibler", fit.distance(metric = "kl")

    # Compute generic set of measures to evaluate the quality of the factorization
    sm = fit.summary()
    # Print sparseness (Hoyer, 2004) of basis and mixture matrix
    print "Sparseness W: %5.3f  H: %5.3f" % (sm['sparseness'][0], sm['sparseness'][1])
    # Print actual number of iterations performed
    print "Iterations", sm['n_iter']

    # Print estimate of target matrix V
    print "Estimate\n", dot(W.todense(), H.todense())
```
