<p>The add-on will consist of a set of widgets, each with it&#x27;s own dedicated purpose, which can be seamlessly connected to provide most commonly used image preprocessing functionality.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the widgets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Widget for viewing image files (add description)</li>
<li>Widget for resizing an image</li>
<li>Widget for rotation/flipping of the image</li>
<li>Widget for converting the color mode (RGB, HSV, Grayscale etc.)</li>
<li>Widget for changing the hue/saturation, brightness/contrast and inverting the image</li>
<li>Widget for generic transformations through convolution with a matrix</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, if there is enough time left throughout the GSoC period, a face detection widget will be built in order to demonstrate the power of the underlying libraries.</p>
<p>These are all things that have been implemented in Python before. Reimplementing them is of course a rather bad idea, so I will use an library called <a href="http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/">OpenCV</a>. It is written in C++ and has Python bindings, and is the most widely used computer vision library, by far. So the core of the widgets will be written in it, and the GUI using <a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro">PyQT</a>, the library used for building the Orange Canvas.</p>
<p>Although working with images is not Oranges&#x27; main thing, the knowledge gathered while developing the add-on will be used to improve in a number of ways: finding a general structure for add-ons developed in the future, improving the way they are distributed and the way they are tested.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to thank the Orange core team for having faith in me and giving me the chance to spend the summer working on an idea I care about. I&#x27;m very grateful for that and I hope I&#x27;ll exceed their expectations.</p></div></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"author":"BIOLAB","date":"2012-05-15 06:00:00+00:00","draft":false,"title":"Orange GSoC: Computer vision add-on for Orange","type":"blog","blog":["computervision","gsoc"]},"content":{"compiledSource":"/*@jsxRuntime automatic @jsxImportSource react*/\nconst {Fragment: _Fragment, jsx: _jsx, jsxs: _jsxs} = arguments[0];\nconst {useMDXComponents: _provideComponents} = arguments[0];\nfunction _createMdxContent(props) {\n  const _components = Object.assign({\n    p: \"p\",\n    a: \"a\",\n    ul: \"ul\",\n    li: \"li\"\n  }, _provideComponents(), props.components);\n  return _jsxs(_Fragment, {\n    children: [_jsxs(_components.p, {\n      children: [\"This summer I got the chance to develop an add-on for Orange that will introduce basic computer vision functionality, as a part of \", _jsx(_components.a, {\n        href: \"http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2012\",\n        children: \"Google Summer of Code\"\n      }), \".\"]\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"The add-on will consist of a set of widgets, each with it's own dedicated purpose, which can be seamlessly connected to provide most commonly used image preprocessing functionality.\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"Here is a list of the widgets:\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsxs(_components.ul, {\n      children: [\"\\n\", _jsx(_components.li, {\n        children: \"Widget for viewing image files (add description)\"\n      }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.li, {\n        children: \"Widget for resizing an image\"\n      }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.li, {\n        children: \"Widget for rotation/flipping of the image\"\n      }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.li, {\n        children: \"Widget for converting the color mode (RGB, HSV, Grayscale etc.)\"\n      }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.li, {\n        children: \"Widget for changing the hue/saturation, brightness/contrast and inverting the image\"\n      }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.li, {\n        children: \"Widget for generic transformations through convolution with a matrix\"\n      }), \"\\n\"]\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"Also, if there is enough time left throughout the GSoC period, a face detection widget will be built in order to demonstrate the power of the underlying libraries.\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsxs(_components.p, {\n      children: [\"These are all things that have been implemented in Python before.
