We've recently published two more videos in our Getting Started with Orange series. The series is intended to introduce beginners to Orange and teach them how to use its components.



The first video explains how to do hierarchical clustering and select interesting subsets directly in Orange:

The seventh video in the series will address how to score classification and regression models by different evaluation methods. Fruits and vegetables data set can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ajdapretnar/datasets/master/data/fruits-and-vegetables-train.tab).



If you have an idea what you'd like to see in the upcoming videos, let us know!
