**IMPORT DATA**



One of the first tasks in Orange data analysis is of course loading your data. If you are using Orange through Python, this is as easy as riding a bike:

```
    import Orange
    data = Orange.data.Table(“iris”)
    print (data)
```

This will return a neat data table of the famous Iris data set in the console.



**CREATE YOUR OWN DATA TABLE**



What if you want to create your own data table from scratch? Even this is surprisingly simple. First, import the Orange data library.

```
    from Orange.data import *
```



Set all the attributes you wish to see in your data table. For discrete attributes call **DiscreteVariable** and set the name and the possible values, while for a continuous variable call **ContinuousVariable** and set only the attribute name.

```
    color = DiscreteVariable(“color”, values=[“orange”, “green”, “yellow”])
    
    calories = ContinuousVariable(“calories”)
    
    fiber = ContinuousVariable(“fiber”)]
    
    fruit = DiscreteVariable("fruit”, values=[”orange", “apple”, “peach”])
```



Then set the domain for your data table. See how we set class variable with **class_vars**?

```
    domain = Domain([color, calories, fiber], class_vars=fruit)
```



Time to input your data!

```
    data = Table(domain, [
    
    [“green”, 4, 1.2, “apple”],
    
    ["orange", 5, 1.1, "orange"],
    
    ["yellow", 4, 1.0, "peach"]])
```



And now print what you have created!

```
    print(data)
```



One final step:

```
    Table.save(table, "fruit.tab")
```



Your data is safely stored to your computer (in the Python folder)! Good job!
