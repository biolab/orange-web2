Indeed, we are giving away free Orange T-shirts. The T-shirt comes with another free item, our tutorial for survival analysis. Actually, the right order of tasks for you, data enthusiast, is to:
- Enroll in the [tutorial](https://books.biolab.si/books/survival-analysis).
- Watch the videos, solve some quizzes.
- Upon completing the tutorial, fill in the form for the **free T-shirt**.

We will send the free T-shirt to the **first 200 participants** who complete the tutorials and **optional questionaries** before **January 20, 2024**.

The tutorial is the first one in our new series of self-paced data science tutorials. We have designed them for those interested in natural sciences, but the tutorials should also be accessible to other professions. While no background knowledge is assumed for participation in the tutorials, the tutorial makes use of Orange and you have to know how to use it. If you are a complete beginner in Orange, you can start with [Intro to Data Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1ibqB_cvlE&list=PLmNPvQr9Tf-b_SuBdoRsuNhTmaHJ0eKab) youtube series and watch few videos before you dive into the tutorial.

Here is an example section from the tutorial, just to show you what to expect.

The tutorial is structured as a self-paced, engaging series with video lectures, comprehensive notes, and quizzes to test your understanding. We estimate that any Orange user could complete the tutorial within **two or three hours of work**.

By participating in this tutorial, you'll not only improve your data science skills but also play an important role in helping us improve our educational materials. As you go through the tutorial, we invite you to share your thoughts via brief questionnaires.
