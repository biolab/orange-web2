Previously only available in Orange 2, it has been rewritten and is accessible in the prototype add-on. This way, one need not go through the trouble of <a href="/blog/2022/2022-01-10-orange2/">compiling older versions</a> anymore.</p>
<p>But what does it do?</p>
<p>It computes and displays the <a href="http://stat.columbia.edu/~jakulin/Int/">interaction</a> between attributes by calculating the mutual information between them and a third target variable. Doing so provides insight into the data at hand and aids in the search for better visualizations and predictive models.</p>
<p>As far as visualizations go, consider <a href="/widget-catalog/visualize/scatterplot/">Scatter Plot</a>. Connecting Interactions to the <em>Features</em> input allows the user to manually select the projection, similarly to the <em>find informative projections</em> button, but with a little more oomph. Enabling sorting, filtering, attribute selection, and offering a clear view into, where the information is coming from, be it from one single feature or a specific combination.</p>
<p>Another, possibly even more intriguing application would be, as mentioned, improving the performance of prediction models. To illustrate, let&#x27;s take a look at the <em>MONK</em> dataset, readily available directly within Orange, in the <a href="/widget-catalog/data/datasets/">Datasets</a> widget. First, we can try and see how well a Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) can predict the target variable like so.</p>
<img src="/blog/2022-04-interactions/2022-05-06-interactions-workflow.png" class="slug__WSImage-sc-1xtdpf8-1 hFKfMl"/>
<p>Taking, for example, the Area Under Curve (AUC) score of <code>0.741</code> as a  baseline, we can see that, already, our model performs quite well. But we know we can do better than that! We want to see what makes the model tick, so let&#x27;s take a closer look at our data by utilizing the new interactions widget in our workflow and examining the results.</p>
<img src="/blog/2022-04-interactions/2022-05-06-interactions.png" class="slug__WSImage-sc-1xtdpf8-1 hFKfMl"/>
<p>While neither <code>a</code> nor <code>b</code> carries much information independently, their combination tells a great deal about our target variable. With this in mind, we can now use the <a href="/widget-catalog/transform/featureconstructor/">Feature Constructor</a> widget to combine attributes <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> into a single feature and retrain our model. Applying all these steps then yields a workflow resembling this.</p>
<img src="/blog/2022-04-interactions/2022-05-06-interactions-updated-workflow.png" class="slug__WSImage-sc-1xtdpf8-1 hFKfMl"/>
<p>Lo and behold! It looks like the extra trouble has paid off. We have managed to improve our model&#x27;s performance and have ended up with an AUC score of <code>1.0</code> by accounting for the codependence of variables (something models such as NBC lack by definition).</p>
<p>I hope this short display sheds some light on all the possibilities interaction analysis provides and urge you to try it out on some real-world data.</p></div></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"author":"Noah Nov≈°ak","date":"2022-05-13","draft":false,"title":"Predictive Modelling with Attribute Interactions","type":"blog","thumbImage":"2022-05-06-interactions.png","frontPageImage":"2022-05-06-interactions.png","blog":["orange","interaction","addons"],"shortExcerpt":"A quick introduction to using the new Interactions widget in Orange 3","longExcerpt":"The Interactions widget has been added back to Orange 3.
