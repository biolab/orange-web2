<p><a href="http://orange.biolab.si">Orange</a> has been recognized for <em>making data more approachable</em>, which has been our goal from the get-go. The tool is continually being developed with the end user in mind - someone who wants to analyze his/her data quickly, visually, interactively, and efficiently.
