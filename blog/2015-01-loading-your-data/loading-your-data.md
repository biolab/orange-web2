By a popular demand, we have just published a [tutorial](https://docs.biolab.si/orange/3/visual-programming/loading-your-data/index.html) on how to load the data table into Orange. Besides its own [.tab format](https://docs.biolab.si/orange/3/data-mining-library/reference/data.io.html), Orange can load any tab or comma delimited data set. The details are though in writing header rows that tell Orange about the type and domain of each attribute. The [tutorial](https://docs.biolab.si/orange/3/visual-programming/loading-your-data/index.html) is a step-by-step description on how to do this and how to transfer the data from popular spreadsheet programs like Excel.
