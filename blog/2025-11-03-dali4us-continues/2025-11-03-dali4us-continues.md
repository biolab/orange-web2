The [DALI4US](https://www.dali4us.eu) project continues! In the 2025/26 school year, teachers in Ireland, Luxembourg, and Slovenia will embark on *four journeys into artificial intelligence* together with their students. They will independently carry out four activities designed to help them explore different areas of AI in a hands-on approach. In Slovenia, we're thrilled to be collaborating with over 70 teachers and more than 2000 students from 51 primary schools!

We've selected four activities from the [Pumice website](https://gairdin.eu) and made them even more practical and accessible - in fact, for part of each lesson, teachers won't need a computer at all! First, students will try to solve a problem on their own, and then, in the second part of the lesson, they'll explore how a computer tackles the same challenge. 

How does Netflix recommend movies? Why does YouTube show us different videos?<br />
In the first challenge, students will explore recommendation systems (for cartoons!). In the first part of the lesson, they'll design their own recommendation system on paper. In the second part, they'll see how a computer builds it for the whole class.

Can a computer predict the success of an operation? Can it diagnose a disease based on symptoms?<br />
In the second challenge, students will learn about classification models - in a very fun way! In the first part of the lesson, they'll try to predict professions of gnomes based on their appearance. In the second part, they'll create a challenge for the computer: can it predict a gnome's profession based on what their house looks like?

In the third challenge, students will explore clustering using climate zones in Asia as an example. In the first part of the lesson, they'll create four clusters themselves, and then they'll see how well a computer performs the same task.

In the fourth challenge, students will compete against a computer in the game Hexapawn. Through play, they'll discover reinforcement learning and discuss what artificial intelligence actually means.

Preparations are in full swing! Before the holidays, we printed and purchased all the necessary materials - and there were quite a few boxes! :) For a few days, we set up a packing station in one of our faculty offices.

We prepared a package for each school - teachers will find plenty of paper, some colorful stones, and plastic cups inside each box.

Teachers will find detailed instructions for all activities on this [website](https://notes.biolab.si/books/dali4us/izleti-v-ui). To make the computer-based parts of the lessons even easier to execute, we're developing an online version of the Orange platform - and we've embedded the widgets directly into the website!

This week, we'll hold an introductory Zoom meeting, and we're looking forward to meeting all the participating teachers!
