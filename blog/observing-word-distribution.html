It makes it easier to determine the preprocessing techniques and downstream analysis (the selection of document frequency weights, topic modelling technique, lemmatization and so on).</p>
<p>Even though Orange sometimes doesn&#x27;t have a widget for a specific task, the said task can be achieved with a combination of widgets and their outputs. Let us look at an example of word distribution. There is no such widget in Orange, but word distributions are generally available in <a href="https://orangedatamining.com/widget-catalog/text-mining/wordcloud/">Word Cloud</a>. Word Cloud shows a list of most frequent words and their frequencies on the left and a cloud visualization on the right.</p>

<p>This is a great start, but Word Cloud only shows the 100 words and the visualization doesn&#x27;t directly correspond to the word frequency (words are scaled so that very frequent words don&#x27;t overwhelm less frequent ones). Yet Word Cloud has an output called <strong>Word Counts</strong>, which outputs a table with words and their frequencies in columns. Just what we would like to see!</p>

<p>Can we see these frequencies as distributions? Yes, we can. A general widget showing numeric values (such as word counts) is <a href="https://orangedatamining.com/widget-catalog/visualize/barplot/">Bar Plot</a>. We pass the Word Counts output of Word Cloud to Bar Plot. We can also label each bar by setting Annotations to Word.</p>

<p>If we zoom in, we can see that &quot;the&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, &quot;of&quot;, &quot;to&quot;, &quot;a&quot; are by far the most frequent words. This calls for some preprocessing, particularly stopword removal. We place <a href="https://orangedatamining.com/widget-catalog/text-mining/preprocesstext/">Preprocess Text</a> between Corpus and Word Cloud and use default preprocessing. Our bar plot has changed. Now, the most frequent word is &quot;said&quot;, so perhaps another round of stopword removal is necessary.</p>
