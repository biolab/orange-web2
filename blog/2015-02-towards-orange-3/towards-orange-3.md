We are rushing, full speed ahead, towards [Orange 3](http://orange.biolab.si/orange3/). A complete revamp of Orange in Python 3 changes its data model to that of numpy, making Orange compatible with an array of Python-based data analytics. We are rewriting all the widgets for visual programming as well. We have two open fronts: the scripting part, and the widget part. So much to do, but it is going well: the closed tasks for widgets are those on the left of [Anze](http://www.fri.uni-lj.si/en/anze-staric/) (the board full of sticky notes), and those open, in minority, are on Anze's right. Oh, by the way, it's Anze who is managing the work and he looks quite happy.
