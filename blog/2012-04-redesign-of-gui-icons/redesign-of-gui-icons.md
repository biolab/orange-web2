Orange GUI is being redesigned. Expect a welcome screen with selection of preloaded widget schemes, simpler access to computational components, and integration with intelligent interface (widget suggestions). For the project we have engaged a designer [Peter ÄŒuhalev](http://yukaii.com/). To give you a taste of what is going on, here are some icons for widget sets that are being redesigned. There are in B/W, the color will be decided on and added in later stages. Below are just the icons - widget symbols with no frames. Current frames are rounded squares, while it looks like the widget frames for the new GUI will be circles. New icons are designed in a vector format.
