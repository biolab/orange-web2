Student application period for [Google Summer of Code 2011](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2011) has ended. We got 47 proposals from students all around the world. Now it is time for us to evaluate them and select the best proposals and the best students to work this year on Orange.
