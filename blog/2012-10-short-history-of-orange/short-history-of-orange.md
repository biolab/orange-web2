Few weeks back we celebrated [20 years of Slovene Artificial Intelligence Society](http://ailab.ijs.si/dunja/TuringSLAIS-2012/). I have much enjoyed Ivan Bratko's talk on AI history, and his account of events as triggered by late Donald Michie. Many interesting talks followed, including highlights by Stephen Muggleton and Claude Sammut.

The last talk of the event was on Orange. Janez talked about its birth, history and future prospects. You can see his presentation on [videolectures](http://videolectures.net/is2012_demsar_orange/) and check out the [paper](http://ailab.ijs.si/dunja/TuringSLAIS-2012/Papers/Demsar_Orange.pdf) with lecture's notes.
