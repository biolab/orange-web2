Dear Orange users,

Some of you might have an issue installing add-ons with the following issue popping up:

`xmlrpc.client.Fault: <Fault -32601: 'server error; requested method not found'>`

This is the result of the migration to a new infrastructure at [PyPi](https://pypi.org/), which provides the installation of add-ons. Our team has rallied to adjust the add-on installer so it works with the new and improved service.

In order to make the add-on installer work (again), please [download](https://orange.biolab.si/download/) the latest version of Orange (3.13.0).

We apologize for any inconvenience and wish you a fruitful data analysis in the future.

Yours truly,

Orange team
