This project aims to build a neural network library based on some great existing NN libraries, notably the Flood Library, which already provides a fully functional Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) implementation. The project starts with implementing a robust, efficient feed forward neural network library, and then will extend it in significant ways that add support for state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Additional extensions include building a PCA framework and improving existing training algorithms and error functional.
