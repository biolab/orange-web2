We are excited to host a three-hour tutorial on data fusion at the [Basel Computational Biology Conference](http://www.bc2.ch/2015/). To this end we have prepared a series of [short lectures notes](http://helikoid.si/bc215/bc2-handouts.pdf) that accompany the recently developed [Data Fusion Add-on for Orange](/blog/2015/06/05/data-fusion-add-on-for-orange/).

We design the tutorial for data mining researchers and molecular biologists with interest in large-scale data integration. In the tutorial we focus on collective latent factor models, a popular class of approaches for data fusion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches on several hands-on case studies from recommendation systems and molecular biology.

This is a high-risk event. I mean, for us, lecturers. Ok, no bricks will probably fall down. But, in the part of the tutorial, this is the first time we are showing Orange's data fusion add-on. And not just showing: part of the tutorial is a hands-on session.

We would like to acknowledge [Biolab](http://www.biolab.si/en/) members for pushing the widgets through the development pipeline under extreme time constraints. Special thanks to Anze, Ales, Jernej, Andrej, Marko, Aleksandar and all other members of the lab.
