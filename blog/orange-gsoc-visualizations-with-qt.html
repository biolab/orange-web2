My task is to replace the current visualization framework based on Qwt with a custom library, depending only on Qt. This library will better support Orange&#x27;s very specific visualizations and will replace the unmaintained PyQwt.</p>
<p>I have a lot of experience with Qt and its graphics classes, both in C++ and Python, but I&#x27;m relatively now to Orange. As a physics student, especially now that I&#x27;m selecting a computational physics program, this a great learning opportunity for me.</p>
<p>I think my work is progressing very well, because many visualizations already work with the new library with only minor modifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scatterplot</li>
<li>Linear projections</li>
<li>Discretize</li>
<li>All the visualizations in VizRank and FreeViz dialogs</li>
</ul>
<p>The library is written partially in C++, especially the performance-sensitive parts, and partially in Python. It uses the Qt Graphics View Framework, with several reimplemented or wrapped method to preserve the old behavior and API. I have tried to keep the necessary modification to the widgets themselves to a minimum, so the large majority of changes are in the OWGraph class which server as the base class for all graphs.</p>
<p>Graphs made by Qwt are not very flexible, they only support graphs with cartesian axes. On the other hand, visualization Orange often use custom axes and transformations. That&#x27;s why I designed the new library with support for arbitrary axes, curves and other elements. All of these can be extendeng with classes written in Python, C++, or a combination thereof. The required changes to visualizations I already ported to the new OWGraph class were mostly simplifications, with very little new code added.</p>
<p>For example, zooming and selection is implemented completely in the new OWGraph class, with the same function and attribute names as before, so visualizations themselves didn&#x27;t need any changes at all.</p>
<p>The new framework is also able to produce much nicer graphs. I haven&#x27;t had the time to customize the looks much, but it&#x27;s possible to set colors, line widths, point sizes and symbols from Python. There are still some settings that have no UI configuration, but I will focus on that after making sure that visualization widgets work with the new library.</p>
<p>Currently I&#x27;m trying to change as many widgets as possible to the new classes. As I said above, I only completed a few of them, but I believe the others won&#x27;t require too much work.</p></div></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"frontmatter":{"author":"BIOLAB","date":"2011-06-30 12:55:00+00:00","draft":false,"title":"Orange GSoC: Visualizations with Qt","type":"blog","blog":["gsoc","visualization"]},"content":{"compiledSource":"/*@jsxRuntime automatic @jsxImportSource react*/\nconst {Fragment: _Fragment, jsx: _jsx, jsxs: _jsxs} = arguments[0];\nconst {useMDXComponents: _provideComponents} = arguments[0];\nfunction _createMdxContent(props) {\n  const _components = Object.assign({\n    p: \"p\",\n    ul: \"ul\",\n    li: \"li\"\n  }, _provideComponents(), props.components);\n  return _jsxs(_Fragment, {\n    children: [_jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"Hello, my name is Miha Čančula and this summer I'm working on Orange as part of Google's Summer of Code program, mentored by Miha Štajdohar.
