We&#x27;ve been getting many requests to bring back Neural Network widget, but we also had many reservations about it.</p>
<p>Neural networks are powerful and great, but to do them right is not straight-forward. And to do them right in the context of a GUI-based visual programming tool like Orange is a twisted double helix of a roller coaster.</p>
<p>Do we make each layer a widget and then stack them? Do we use parallel processing or try to do something server-side? Theano or Keras? Tensorflow perhaps?</p>
<p>We were so determined to do things properly, that after the n-th iteration we still had no clue what to actually do.</p>
<p>Then one day a silly novice programmer (a.k.a. me) had enough and just threw scikit-learn&#x27;s <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neural_networks_supervised.html">Multi-layer Perceptron model</a> into a widget and called it a day. There you go. A Neural Network widget just like it was in Orange2 - a wrapper for a scikit&#x27;s function that works out-of-the-box. Nothing fancy, nothing powerful, but it does its job. It models things and it predicts things.</p>
<p>Just like that:</p>
