Do you love Orange? Do you think it is the best thing since sliced bread? Want to thank all the developers for their hard work?

Nothing says thank you like a fresh supply of ice cream and now you can help us stock our fridge with your generous donations. 🍦🍦🍦


[Donate](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=A76TAX87ZVR3J)

Support open source software and the team behind Orange. We promise to squander all your contributions purely on ice cream. Can't have a development sprint without proper refreshments! ;)

Thank you in advance for all the contributions, encouragement and support! It wouldn't be worth it without you.
